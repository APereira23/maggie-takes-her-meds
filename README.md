Maggie likes to keep her meds organized. Now she has a custom App to help her with that.

<strong>Maggie Takes Her Meds</strong> is a simple notebook-type app that uses local storage to save data. It was built as a part of <strong>The Odin Project</strong>'s React course. This is a first build, with additional server-dependent features planned to be added as soon as the necessary skills to handle the backend are introduced in the course.
